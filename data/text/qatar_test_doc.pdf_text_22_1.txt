the upgrade to a new real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system towards a more integrated
wholesale payment system will reduce risks and enhance efficiency in the central bank’s secured
lending operations. Over time, establishing a wider and more stable policy interest rate corridor,
developing a more active interbank market, and allowing banks to base their lending rates fully on
market conditions by removing the cap on salary-based personal loans would further enhance
monetary policy transmission. Greater central bank communication would also be important to
support these efforts.
