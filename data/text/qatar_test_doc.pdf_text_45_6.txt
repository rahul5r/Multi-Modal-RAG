NDS3 stresses that the state should become an “enabler” of more vibrant and 
sustainable private sector-driven growth. A wide range of reforms are envisaged to close 
remaining gaps in innovation, human capital, and the regulatory environment. NDS3 highlights the 
need to harmonize economic zones to help attract FDI, boost international trade including through 
additional trade agreements with key target markets, and Public-Private partnership (PPP) to 
facilitate private sector participation. It also identifies “diversification clusters” to build comparative 
advantages, setting ambitious targets both at the sectoral level and on macroeconomic outcomes.
