Figure 3. Qatar: External Sector Developments 
After appreciating for 2 years through end-2022, 
effective exchange rates have weakened.... 
 
…while key hydrocarbon prices have declined. 
 
 
The current account surplus moderated in 2023 amid 
lower hydrocarbon prices and export volume… 
 
… matched mostly by portfolio investment outflows.  
 
 
QCB reserves thus increased only moderately.  
 
Exchange rate forwards have returned to around 
parity.
