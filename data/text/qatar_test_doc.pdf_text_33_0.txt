Figure 1. Qatar: Real Sector Developments 
Non-hydrocarbon activity weakened in 2023…  
 
…as construction contracted and trade, transportation 
and real estate weakened.  
 
 
 
Real estate prices remained weak albeit having 
started to recover more recently…   
 
…while manufacturing production is showing signs of 
troughing. 
 
 
  
Strong population and employment growth support 
domestic demand…  
 
…as labor force participation recovered to pre-COVID 
level.
