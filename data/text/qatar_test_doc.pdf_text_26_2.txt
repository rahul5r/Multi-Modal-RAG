Attracting FDI and boosting domestic knowledge spillovers. FDI inflows to Qatar have
traditionally focused on the hydrocarbon sector, but more recently inflows to knowledge sectors
(e.g., ICT) rose. Further reducing entry barriers for foreign firms and promoting healthy

including to strengthen SMEs’ access to technology via financing, could facilitate domestic
knowledge spillovers from FDI.
