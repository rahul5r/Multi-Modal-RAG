expenditure-based fiscal consolidation. The authorities have made good progress in expanding program-based 
budgeting to eventually cover all sectors by the end of 2025 and expect that the ongoing expenditure review would 
generate savings in the medium term. Moreover, the authorities plan to enhance their macroeconomic projections 
to support the medium-term budget update. The authorities view the fiscal risks from ongoing PPPs, mainly on 
operating and maintaining existing infrastructure, to be minimal.
