and remittance outflows remained stable despite a rise in expatriate employment. The QCB’s 
international reserves rose gradually to US$53.8 billion in November 2024, strengthening the reserve 
coverage (projected to reach 62 percent of the ARA metric by end 2024). This is complemented by 
the sizeable foreign assets held by Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), estimated to have exceeded 
200 percent of GDP in 2023, through which a significant share of the hydrocarbon windfalls is 
invested abroad. The external position is assessed to be moderately stronger than the level 
suggested by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies (Annex II).
