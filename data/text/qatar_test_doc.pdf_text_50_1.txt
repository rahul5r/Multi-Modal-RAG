significant reliance on hydrocarbons complicates the application of standard external assessment 
methodologies, given the large hydrocarbon price volatility in 2020–22 and more recent export volume 
volatility. Some of the volatility is captured by the adjustments for cyclical contributions and conflicts 
(0.9 percent and -1.1 percent of GDP, respectively). As the current account surplus is projected to moderate 
further in 2024, the CA gap is expected to narrow, aligning the external position more with the level implied 
by fundamentals and desirable policies.
