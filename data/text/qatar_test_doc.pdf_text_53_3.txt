and negative) are kept. Judgement based on economic theories and knowledge of the Qatari 
economy is then applied to ensure balanced sectoral coverage, narrowing the final pool to 
13 variables. Further refinements of variable selection can be done by conducting Shapley 
decomposition of nowcasting results to identify contributions from different predicative 
variables and iterate with alternative variables.

Machine learning (ML) models are applied to handle large and complex datasets. Unlike 
traditional methods such as statistical models and surveys, ML models allow for better 
integration of complex, non-linear relationships between economic variables that ARIMA models
