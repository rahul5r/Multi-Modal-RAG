to empower women and close gender gaps, including in education and the labor market. Recent
efforts include to allow flexible and remote work arrangements, and to lengthen paid maternity
leaves in government agencies. Continued efforts to increase female labor force participation,
especially in the private sector, would enhance overall labor force skills and Qatar’s productivity.
Encouraging female students to focus on subjects with more private sector demand, providing
special entrepreneurship programs, and increasing female representation in decision making
bodies would also allow Qatar to benefit more from this talent pool. 13
