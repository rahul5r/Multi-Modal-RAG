Qatar has made excellent progress in fighting financial crimes, as acknowledged by the 2023 AML/CFT mutual 
evaluation report by FATF which highlighted the strength in preventing financial crimes and law enforcement 
through improved risk assessment capacity and clearer policy priorities. The QCB has also banned financial 
institutions to use crypto assets. The authorities remain firmly committed to strengthening the AML/CFT framework 
in alignment with global standards, with a focus on risk-based supervision and effective enforcement to uphold
