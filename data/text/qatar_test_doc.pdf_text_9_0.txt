Inflation continued to moderate amid the growth normalization and tighter monetary 
policy (Figure 2 and Text Figure 3). Headline inflation declined from 5 percent in 2022 to 3.0 percent 
in 2023 (period average). It decelerated further to 1.2 percent in 2024 through October as rent and 
recreation services inflation weakened. Producer price and wage inflation remained contained.
