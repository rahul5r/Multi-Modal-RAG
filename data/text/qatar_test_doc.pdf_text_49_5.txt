volume declined amid the regional conflict. Tourism remained strong while both imports and remittance 
outflows declined (normalizing after the 2022 FIFA World Cup). In 2024H1, the current account surplus 
remained little changed from 2023H1 (US$20 billion). Hydrocarbon exports continued to edge lower and 
imports increased as growth started to rebound but tourism remained strong. The current account surplus is 
thus expected to abate somewhat to 16½ percent of GDP in 2024 and remain at around 15½ percent of 
GDP in the medium-term buoyed by the LNG production expansion in the North Field and relatively high, 
albeit gradually falling, hydrocarbon prices.
