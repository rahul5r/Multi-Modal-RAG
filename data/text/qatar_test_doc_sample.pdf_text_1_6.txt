1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff 
team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments 
and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
