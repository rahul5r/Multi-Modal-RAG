Figure 5. Qatar: Credit and Financial Sector Developments 
Real private sector credit growth picked up since late 
2023… 
…while credit to the public sector remains the largest 
share of bank assets. 
Banks’ credit to non-hydro GDP gap is estimated to be 
negative in 2023. 
Bank foreign liabilities remained elevated but 
moderating… 
…owing to a fall in other foreign liabilities more 
recently.  
Changes in maturity structure of cross-border bank 
lending to Qatar has been mixed.
