stance could de-anchor inflation expectations is 
limited. On the other hand, a monetary stance too 
tight for too long than warranted could negatively 
affect demand, but the ongoing public investment 
and spillovers from the North Field LNG expansion 
will support growth. 
Maintain monetary policy and liquidity 
management that are consistent with the 
currency peg. Continue to closely monitor 
banking sector developments to ensure 
financial stability. If growth is negatively 
affected by unduly tight (imported) monetary 
policy stance, some fiscal space could be 
deployed to provide targeted support while 
maintaining broad fiscal prudence.
