Text Figure 19. FDI Commitments and Competitiveness 
FDI commitments in non-hydrocarbon sectors 
progressively declined… 
…but the shares of those into high value-added sectors 
increased. 
Qatar’s competitiveness is strong, compared to 
regional peers… 
…and can benefit from a more open and enabling 
business environment, with better access to finance.
