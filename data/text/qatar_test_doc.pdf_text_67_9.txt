Development Strategy. Risks are two 
sided. On the upside, implementation could 
be faster, more efficient, and better 
coordinated than expected. On the 
downside, insufficient coordination and 
implementation capacity could lead to 
resource misallocation and slower progress.  
Faster-than-expected implementation would boost 
medium-term growth more than envisaged. Slower-
than-expected implementation would result in 
weaker-than-envisaged output gains. Resource 
misallocation would also entail larger fiscal costs.  
Properly sequence reforms and enhance 
inter-agency coordination to ensure 
appropriate resource allocation and smooth 
implementation. Regularly monitor and
