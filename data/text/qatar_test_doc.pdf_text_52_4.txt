to avoid overfitting – a situation where the model is too "tailored" to the training data and fails 
to generalize to other situations, leading to inaccurate predictions.

Select nowcasting models. The selected time series data are processed through advanced 
machine learning algorithms (see below). A variety of models, including Support Vector 
Machines (SVMs), Random Forests, and Elastic Net, are trained by historical data. Each model's 
performance is evaluated using a range of metrics (e.g., out-of-sample root-mean-squared error 
(RMSE)), and the best-performing models are selected for further analysis.
