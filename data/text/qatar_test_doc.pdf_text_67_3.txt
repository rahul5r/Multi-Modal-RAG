individuals and businesses, the theft of sensitive 
information, and disruptions in key operations

Qatar has expanded its capacity to contain 
cyberthreats by creating the National 
Cybersecurity Agency in 2021. A National 
Cybersecurity Strategy 2024-30 has been 
launched in September 2024 to further 
enhance legislation, coordinate with the ICT 
sector, and strike a balance between ensuring 
cybersecurity and promoting innovation. 
Effective implementation of the strategy, and 
continued close monitoring and supervision 
including of the banking and payment 
systems are key.
