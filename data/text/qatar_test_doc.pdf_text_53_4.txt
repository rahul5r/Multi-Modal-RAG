traditional methods such as statistical models and surveys, ML models allow for better 
integration of complex, non-linear relationships between economic variables that ARIMA models 
might miss due to their linear structure and reliance on smaller, time-series data. ML models can 
also adapt to changing patterns in data more efficiently than statistical models. They can learn 
from outliers, non-stationarity, and other irregularities, potentially yielding more accurate and 
timelier GDP nowcasts.
