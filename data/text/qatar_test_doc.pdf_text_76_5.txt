The Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) 2024-2030 marks the final phase of the Qatar National Vision 
2030. Since launching the National Vision in 2008, Qatar has made significant strides by leveraging energy sector 
revenues to build world-class infrastructure and institutions. As a result, Qatar’s nonhydrocarbon economy has 
grown to account for about two-thirds of the total output, which underscores Qatar’s commitment to long-term 
economic diversification.
