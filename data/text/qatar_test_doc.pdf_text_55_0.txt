While a useful tool, the ML-based nowcasting framework comes with caveats. ML 
models are primarily focused on identifying statistical patterns in the dataset. The variable and 
model selections aim to maximize predictive power, and the results (including contributions from 
variables) should not be interpreted in the same way as in regression analysis, which is usually based 
on economic theories.
