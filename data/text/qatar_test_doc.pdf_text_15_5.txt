1/ Mainly based on the IMF subsidy database (2023), 
which follows the price gap approach. The benchmark 
price for calculating subsidies is based on the 
international price for energy products that are 
internationally traded. BHR and KWT = IEA (2022); OMN = 
IMF team estimate. Qatar = IEA (2022) for gas, and IMF 
(2023) for electricity and petroleum; SAU = IMF (2023)
