5/ Nominal value at any moment in time is the amount the debtor owes to the creditor. It reflects the value of the instrument at creation and subsequent 
economic flows (such as transactions, exchange rate, and other valuation changes other than market price changes, and other volume changes). 
6/ The face value of a debt instrument is the undiscounted amount of principal to be paid at (or before) maturity. 
7/ Market value of debt instruments is the value as if they were acquired in market transactions on the balance sheet reporting date (reference date). Only 
traded debt securities have observed market values.
