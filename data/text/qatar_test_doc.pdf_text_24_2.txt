enhance expatriate labor market protection and flexibility. Speedy implementation of newly
introduced programs targeting higher-skilled expatriate labor (e.g., new visa schemes including
a five-year Mustaqel residence visa for foreign talent and entrepreneurs and a visa extension
program for graduating students to find jobs in Qatar) would improve labor force skills.
Strengthening the social safety net including the pension scheme would also help. The renewed
4-year collaboration program with ILO can support the authorities’ progress.
