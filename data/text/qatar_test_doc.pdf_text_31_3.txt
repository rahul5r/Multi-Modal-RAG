Qatar has a favorable economic outlook and continues to demonstrate resilience to
external shocks. Recent indicators suggest that the post-World Cup growth normalization has
bottomed out and the gradual rebound in economic activities is gaining momentum. The medium-
term outlook is more positive, driven by significant increases in LNG production and the anticipated
benefits from NDS3 implementation. By maintaining prudent macroeconomic policies and
accelerating reform efforts, Qatar can further solidify its resilience to shocks and prosperity.
