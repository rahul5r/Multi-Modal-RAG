smaller, effects. When a country has high levels of human and physical capital, the amplification
effect (with economic complexity) on 
output is even stronger. Qatar has 
built a large capital stock with top-
notch infrastructure quality, but its 
labor productivity and economic 
complexity have substantial room to 
improve. Reforms should thus focus 
on: (i) building a highly skilled labor 
force, (ii) promoting innovation and 
knowledge-spillovers (including 
through FDI and trade diversification) 
to boost economic complexity, 
supported by enhanced business 
efficiency, (iii) leveraging Qatar’s 
already advanced digital access and AI 
readiness for further productivity
