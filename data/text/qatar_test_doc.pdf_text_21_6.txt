with that of the U.S. Federal Reserve. More recently, the QCB cut policy interest rates three times,
each time 5 basis points more than the US Federal Reserve did, narrowing the interest rate
differential with the US fed funds rate (Figure 2). Going forward, staff recommended that the QCB
continue to adjust its policy rates in line with the US Federal Reserve. The QCB’s enhanced liquidity
management is welcome and could benefit from stronger coordination with the fiscal authority.
