positive outlook provides an opportunity to accelerate revenue diversification including to 
introduce a value-added tax and broaden the corporate income tax, enhance spending 
efficiency and gradually align domestic energy prices with export prices, and reorient 
spending to enable private sector-driven growth. Adopting a full-fledged medium-term 
fiscal framework, anchored by the benchmark to ensure intergenerational equity, will 
enhance fiscal sustainability while securing priority spending. Greater fiscal transparency 
and risk management, including on Public-Private Partnerships, will support the strategy.
