Fiscal policy. A more sustainable, shock-resistant medium-term fiscal framework is envisaged, 
supported by diversified revenues, efficient expenditures, and relatively low debt. Key 2030 
targets include to reach a fiscal surplus of 5½ percent of GDP (the past five-year-average was 
3 percent), maintain the current sovereign credit ratings of AA/Aa2 with stable outlook, and 
achieve manageable expenditure growth (below the non-hydrocarbon output growth rate). The 
government plans to reduce procyclicality of spending, implement program-based budgeting, 
and enhance debt management through frameworks including sovereign green financing.
