Low 
Long-term risks are low supported by the QIA’s large financial assets, 
manageable aging-related and social security expenditures, and strong 
natural gas reserves. As the cleanest fossil fuel, natural gas will likely 
play a key role for a smoother energy transition relative to fossil fuels 
with higher emission. Qatar's production cost is low. These together 
support sizeable revenues over a long term.
