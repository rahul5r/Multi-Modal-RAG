With lower hydrocarbon prices, both the current account and fiscal surpluses narrowed in 
2023, to 17 percent of GDP and 5½ percent of GDP, respectively. The twin surpluses

both the current and fiscal accounts will likely remain in surpluses, albeit declining as a share 
of GDP, as hydrocarbon prices are projected to fall. 
Banks are well-capitalized, liquid, and profitable, with the capital adequacy ratio of close to 
20 percent and return on equity of 14½ percent, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024.
