The impact would depend on the nature of the 
event. The shock could translate into higher global 
hydrocarbon prices, but there is also the risk of LNG 
export disruption—the overall impact on Qatar is 
highly uncertain. Intensification of regional 
conflict(s) could also weaken investor confidence 
and disrupt supply chain, tourism, and capital flows.  
The policy response would depend on the 
nature of the shock. Qatar has fiscal space to 
respond to a negative shock. The central 
bank should provide adequate liquidity in the 
banking system if needed. Continue to 
closely monitor financial institutions.
