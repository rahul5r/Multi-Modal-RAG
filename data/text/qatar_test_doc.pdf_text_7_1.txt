in fiscal revenue and exports, however, has progressed more slowly. The trend decline in total factor 
productivity has also been a drag to economic growth. Acknowledging these challenges, NDS3 
(launched in January 2024) calls for a decisive transition from the costly state-driven growth model 
to a private sector-led one, with the state becoming an enabler. NDS3 is reform-focused, aiming to 
build a more sustainable and knowledge-based economy, with ambitious targets set and 
“diversification clusters” identified to build comparative advantages (Annex I). Reform momentum 
has strengthened significantly since the launch of NDS3.
