2The ARA is a composite metric that measures the adequacy of precautionary reserves. It is based on the relative risk weights 
for each source of foreign exchange drain drawing on the 10th percentile of observed outflows from emerging market 
economies during exchange market pressure episodes. Reserves in the range of 100–150 percent of the composite metric 
are considered broadly adequate for precautionary purposes.
