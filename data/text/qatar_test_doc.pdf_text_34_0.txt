Policy rates broadly followed the US Fed, with the 
lending-deposit policy rate corridor having narrowed. 
The domestic policy deposit rate has mostly moved less 
than the US Fed Funds rate through the cycles.

…while tradables inflation has been steady. 
Money growth edged up as monetary policy tightening 
stopped.
