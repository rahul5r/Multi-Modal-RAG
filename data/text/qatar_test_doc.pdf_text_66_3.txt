raise the economy’s sensitivity to energy price 
volatility. Higher-than-projected energy prices could 
strengthen fiscal and external positions, and non-
hydrocarbon output growth as ample hydrocarbon 
liquidity and positive private sector confidence 
could boost consumption and investment. Pressures 
to increase public spending could rise. Lower oil 
prices would weaken the external and fiscal 
balances, and growth. 
The authorities should implement a medium-
term fiscal framework which helps insulate 
public spending from oil price volatility. 
Diversifying the revenue base toward more 
non-hydrocarbon sources would reduce 
revenue sensitivity to energy price volatility.
